# Streamlit-Stocks-Dashboard

 I want to build a marketing dashboard and be deployed it on streamlit using python. The dashboard will include visualizations like a line chart, bar chart, pie chart, etc. The charts will be filtered using specific columns also. It's important that the dashboard look visually appealing and attractive.
